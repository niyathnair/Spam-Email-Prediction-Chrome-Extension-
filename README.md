Data Importing: This stage involves importing or loading the dataset into the analysis environment, preparing it for exploration and modeling.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): EDA is a preliminary stage of analysis aimed at summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset. It involves techniques such as data visualization, descriptive statistics, and data mining to understand the structure and patterns within the data.

Model Building: In this stage, statistical or machine learning models are developed using the prepared dataset. These models are trained to predict outcomes, classify data, or uncover relationships within the data.

Data Visualization: Data visualization techniques are employed to represent the data visually, aiding in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships that may be present in the dataset.

Predictions/Accuracies: Once the models are trained, they are used to make predictions on new or unseen data. The accuracy of these predictions is evaluated to assess the performance of the models and determine their effectiveness in solving the problem at hand.
